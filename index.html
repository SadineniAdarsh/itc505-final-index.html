        <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
        <p>Here's a detailed explanation of how to play the Lights Out puzzle game:</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the game is to turn off all the lights on the grid. Each cell in the grid can be in one of two states: on or off.</p>
        <p><strong>Grid:</strong>The game starts with a grid of lights, where some lights are on and some are off. The grid is usually represented as a square with cells that can be clicked to toggle their state.</p>
        <p><strong>Toggle Lights: </strong> Clicking on a cell toggles the state of that cell and the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). For example, if you click on a cell that is currently on, it will turn off, and its adjacent cells will toggle their states as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong>The challenge of the game is to figure out the right sequence of moves to turn off all the lights. Since clicking on a cell affects its neighbors, you need to plan your moves carefully to solve the puzzle.</p>
        <p><strong>Winning: </strong>You win the game when you successfully turn off all the lights on the grid. When this happens, a message will typically appear indicating that you have won.</p>
        <p><strong>Restart: </strong>If you get stuck or want to try a different approach, you can use the restart button to reset the grid to its original state.</p>
        <p><strong>Randomize: </strong>The randomize button allows you to start a new game with a randomly generated grid, providing a fresh challenge each time you play.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge Yourself:</strong>As you become more familiar with the game, you can challenge yourself by trying to solve the puzzle in fewer moves or in a shorter amount of time.</p>
        <p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect: </strong>Like many puzzle games, practice is key to improving your skills. The more you play, the better you'll become at recognizing patterns and finding the most efficient solutions.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Creative Choices:</strong>I chose a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, making the puzzle playable on both desktop and mobile devices. I also added a restart button for convenience.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong>One challenge was handling cell toggling and updating adjacent cells' states efficiently. I overcame this by carefully tracking each cell's state and applying the toggling logic consistently.</li>
            <li><strong>Insights Gained:</strong>Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling techniques. I also learned to approach problems systematically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Conceptualization:</strong>I began by understanding the rules of the Lights Out puzzle, which involves toggling the state of cells in a grid and aiming to turn off all cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Design and Layout:</strong>I decided to use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. I chose a simple and intuitive layout, using a table to represent the grid and buttons for user interaction.</li>
            <li><strong> Implementation: </strong>I started by coding the basic functionality, such as creating the grid, toggling cell states, and checking for a solved puzzle. I used event listeners to detect user clicks and update the grid accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Styling:</strong>I used CSS to style the puzzle grid, cells, buttons, and overall layout. I aimed for a clean and visually appealing design while ensuring that the puzzle remains the focus.</li>
            <li><strong> Testing and Debugging: </strong>I tested the application extensively to ensure it worked as expected. I used browser developer tools to debug any issues and made adjustments to improve user experience.</li>
